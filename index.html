          >Queen Bridget is a lawyer by profession. She is passionate about
          humanity and humanitarian activities. She is the founder of a
          non-profit and non-governmental organization. A foundation that,
          advocates for human rights and women rights, creates awareness through
          education and is committed to changing the narrative and stereotype
          about women and especially the girl-child, specifically on women's
          rights, sexual rights, girl-child marriage, girl-child hawking, VVF,
          menstrual health, and hygiene. Queen Bridget Foundation was born out
          of passion and love to help the needy, and empower women through
          awareness of health issues and women's rights. Today the foundation
          now focuses on the girl child and is committed to empowering the
          girl-child through awareness sessions and education, challenging the
          stereotypes and societal norms against the girl-child.
